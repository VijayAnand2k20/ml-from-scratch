# **Machine Learning from Scratch by creating own ML models**

This repository is dedicated to learning machine learning from scratch with Python by creating own models, without the use of external machine learning frameworks or pre-built machine models.. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms, including how they work, how they are implemented, and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

## Before running
    
To avoid any errors, install the packages from the requirements.txt by running the following commmand in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 1. K-Nearest Neighbour

- Follow the code in `KNN/pre_knn.py` by uncommenting the comments and viewing the changes in the terminal to learn about the data.
- Follow the code in `KNN/knn.py` to learn about the KNN algorithm.
- Follow the code in `KNN/knn_test.py` to learn about the testing of the KNN algorithm.

The code is commented to make it easier to understand.


## 2. Linear Regression

- Follow the code in `LinearRegression/pre_linear_regression.py` by uncommenting the comments and viewing the changes in the terminal to learn about the data.
- Follow the code in `LinearRegression/linear_regression.py` to learn about the Linear Regression algorithm.
- Follow the code in `LinearRegression/linear_regression_test.py` to learn about the testing of the Linear Regression algorithm.

Checkout the readme in `LinearRegression/README.md` for a detailed explanation of the Linear Regression algorithm.
