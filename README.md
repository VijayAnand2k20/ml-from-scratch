# Machine Learning from Scratch by creating own ML models

This repository is dedicated to learning machine learning from scratch with Python by creating own models, without the use of external machine learning frameworks or pre-built machine modles.. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms, including how they work, how they are implemented, and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

## Before running
    
    To avoid any errors, install the packages from the requirements.txt by running the following commmand in your terminal:
    > pip install -r requirements.txt


 This branch consists of a technique called `K-Nearest Neighbour`

## K-Nearest Neighbour

    Follow the code in `KNN/pre_knn.py` by uncommenting the comments and viewing the changes in the terminal.
