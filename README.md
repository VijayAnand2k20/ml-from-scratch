# Machine Learning from Scratch with Native Python

This repository is dedicated to learning machine learning from scratch with native Python code, without the use of external libraries or frameworks. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms, including how they work, how they are implemented, and how they can be applied to real-world problems.
